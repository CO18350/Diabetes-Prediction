# Diabetes Predictor
> Predict Diabetes of a person using Machine Learning algorithms.

Our objective to make this project is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. We have also created web app using flask and compared various machine learning algorithms to see which one is better one.

## Models applied
 - Data gathering
 - Data visualisation
 - Data pre processing
 - Data modeling
   - Logistic regression algorithm
   - K-nearest neighbour algorithm
   - Vector classifier algorithm
   - Naive Bayes algorithm
   - Decision tree algorithm
   - Random Forest algorithm
 - Model Evaluation
